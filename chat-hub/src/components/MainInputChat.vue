    As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am based on the GPT-4 architecture, which is a large language model (LLM). The strengths of this model include:
    Language Understanding and Generation: GPT-4 has the capability to understand and generate text in various languages. This is particularly useful when users ask questions or engage in conversations in different languages. For example, if you ask a question in Korean, I can respond in Korean.
    Programming Knowledge: I possess in-depth knowledge of programming languages like Python and JavaScript. This allows me to assist with writing code, debugging, designing algorithms, and more.
    Expertise in Specialized Fields: I offer a high level of knowledge in specific areas such as chemical molecular simulation. This can be useful in academic research, data analysis, and solving complex problems.
    Versatility: I am capable of performing various tasks such as text generation, summarization, translation, problem-solving, and providing educational materials.
    These strengths enable me to provide substantial support across a wide range of fields and to meet the diverse needs of users.
